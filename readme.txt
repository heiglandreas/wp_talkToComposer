Add all your active plugins to a composer.json-File.

== Description ==

This plugin adds plugins on activation to a composer.json-file and on deactivation removes them.

That way you can handle your plugins via [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Plugins are added to the composer.json via [wpackagist](https://wpackagist.org) which makes
the wordpress-plugin-directory available via git.

But you can also manually add plugins to the pluginlist and on activation the plugin is
checked for a composer.json file and if one exists the name is used to add the plugin to the
composer.json-File.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

There is no configuration needed.
